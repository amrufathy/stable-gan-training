# Stable GAN Training

Project for "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" course.

A Comparison on the stability issues when training different architectures of GANs:
- Vanilla GAN
- DCGAN
- WGAN
- WGAN-GP


## Data
We use the `aligned` CelebA dataset on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg) (`img_align_celeba.zip`)
